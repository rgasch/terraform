= Project Status =

Terraform has seen it's last release in 2000. As such, the codebase needs some fixes in order to work on a current gnome/glade release. We are working on getting the codebase cleaned up and getting the program in shape so that we can release a new version to the general public. 

While we don't have a lot of time to dedicate to this, we are making slow and steady progress. If you are willing and able to help with this, please contact us; we would appreciate any help we can get. 

The current state of the program is that if you do a checkout from SVN you should be able to compile it using a modern gnome/glade environment and get a reasonably stable and well behaved application. There are still some issues to resolve, but the basics now seem to work quite well.  

= New Release!!! =
After some more build-related fixes there's now a new release of terraform, version 0.9.5. Functionally it is more or less the same as the old release from 2001, but the source code has been modularized and updated so that it compiles and runs on an up-to-date GNOME and glade-3 install. Hopefully this will be the starting shot to a new era of active development and functional improvements. 

I would appreciate any help and fixes people can offer since I'm pretty bogged down with work. Happy terraforming.
