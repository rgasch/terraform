Terraform has seen it's last release in 2000. As such, the codebase needs some fixes in order to work on a current gnome/glade release. We are working on getting the codebase cleaned up and getting the program in shape so that we can release a new version to the general public. 

While we don't have a lot of time to dedicate to this, we are making slow and steady progress. If you are willing and able to help with this, please contact us; we would appreciate any help we can get. 

The current state of the program is that if you do a checkout from SVN you should be able to compile it using a modern gnome/glade environment and get a reasonably stable and well behaved application. There are still some issues to resolve, but the basics now seem to work quite well.  


== Fixes applied so far ==
  * Fixed configuration & compilation issues
  * Fixed various crashes at application startup
  * Fixed terraform hanging after spawning an external povray rendering
  * Added dynamic wireframe grid resolution changing based on mousewheel events
