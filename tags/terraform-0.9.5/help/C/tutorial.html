<H1>Terraform Tutorial</H1>

<I>Author: David A. Bartold</I>

<P>
This is a quick tutorial designed for the first time user.
</P>

<HR NOSHADE>

<P>
This is the main window:<BR>
<IMG SRC="mainwindow.png" WIDTH=212 HEIGHT=328>
</P>

<P>
The main window enables the user to open terrain windows.  The user may
load a terrain from a file or create a new one.
</P>

<H2>Step 1:</H2>
<P>
There are various algorithms available for generating a new terrain.
We will let Terraform choose one by selecting File > New > Random.
This is the easiest way to make a new height field.
</P>

<P>
The terrain window will look like this:<BR>
<IMG SRC="terrainwindow.png" WIDTH=316 HEIGHT=394>
</P>

<H2>Step 2:</H2>
<P>
Select the 3D wireframe model view by choosing the View > Type > 3D Wire.
Drag the cursor inside the viewport to rotate the wireframe as desired.
Feel free to try out the other views.
</P>

<P>
3D Wire view:<BR>
<IMG SRC="wire.png" WIDTH=316 HEIGHT=360>
</P>

<H2>Step 3:</H2>
Go to your main window and select File > Options.  The POV-Ray tab will
display an executable name.  Make sure it points to an X capable
version of POV-Ray 3.1.  Terraform will automatically search for
the right executable if you click the "..." button.  This option is saved
between sessions so you will only have to do this once.

<H2>Step 4:</H2>
<P>
Go to your terrain window, select File > Render > POV-Ray and a raytracing
window should appear.
</P>

<P>
If you get an error message, there was a problem executing POV-Ray.  You may
find out more information by clicking the "Details" button.
Consult POV-Ray's documentation if the executable is found but POV-Ray
reports an error.
</P>

<P>
POV-Ray terrain render window:<BR>
<IMG SRC="povray.png" WIDTH=412 HEIGHT=328>
</P>

<H2>Congratulations!</H2>
<P>
You have generated and rendered your first scene.
</P>

<P>
From here, you may wish to save it to a *.terraform file or perform
various operations on the terrain.  Consult the
<A HREF="index.html">Users Guide</A> for more information.
