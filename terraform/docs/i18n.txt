Terraform Internationalization User Info
----------------------------------------

For current version, only english is supported. 

To configure your environment to make use of a language other than the 
default one, set your environment as follows: 
  - sh/ksh/bash users: 	export LANGUAGE=nl
  - csh users: 		setenv LANGUAGE=nl

Once you've done this Terraform will 'speak' Dutch. 

Tips/Warnings:
  - if LC_ALL is set (for example to en_US) it will override LANGUAGE. 
	- unset LC_ALL to clear it
  - if it still doesn't work, try also setting LANG=nl



Terraform Internationalization Development Info
-----------------------------------------------

Terraform uses GNU gettext. All the language files are located in the 
terraform/po directory. The file terraform.pot will handle all the
english strings.

To add support for another language, follow these steps. The example below 
assumes that you want to add the Italian translation. 

1. Copy terraform.pot to it.po ('it' is the language code for Italian)

2. Now add the translations to your it.po file. This is very simple. 
   For each `msgid "<string-to-translate>"' you have to fill the next
   `msgstr ""' with the translation. 

   For example:
	msgid "Close"
	msgstr ""

   Will become:
	msgid "Close"
	msgstr "Chiudi"

   When you do this, beware of Menu strings like
	/File/_Open
   The _ (underscore) character marks the accelerator. Terraform has code 
   in place to automatically detect this marker and deal with it appropriately. 
   You want to make sure however that no character is marked twice with the 
   accellerator marker, as this will confuse the menu code. Ie: You don't 
   want to end up with translations like "_Open" and "Rel_oad" (where the 
   letter 'o' is marked twice). 

3. Add 'it' to the ALL_LINGUAS definition in configure.in 

4. Now run 'autoconf', 'configure', 'make' and 'make install'.

5. Voila! You should now be able to run terraform with Italian messages.



Extra Info/Tips/Tricks/Hints/Ramblings
--------------------------------------

1. If you hacked Terraform and added some strings, you will want to keep the 
   translations already done. Easy.
   Run `make' from the top terraform directory to generate a new terraform.pot
   file. Once you have this file, use 'tupdate' to merge the new strings 
   with the existing translations file. 
	tupdate terraform.pot it.po > it.po.new

   Since version 0.10.35 gettext doesn't provide 'tupdate' anymore. It has been 
   replaced by 'msgmerge'. It works as follows.
	msgmerge -v it.po terraform.pot > it.po.new

2. After executing this commmand the following types of lines may occur:

   #, fuzzy
   This means that it is a "fuzzy" translation. Remove this to see the translation in the program.

   # src/interface.c:12144
   This kind of  lines can also be removed, the strings are no longer in these lines,
   but in these

   #: src/interface.c:1502
   When the colon after the hash sign is removed the line can also be removed.
