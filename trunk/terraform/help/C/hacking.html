<h1>1: Code Style and Data Types</h1>
<p>This section describes the central C++ classes and simple data types that
Terraform relies on.  In order to do any serious work with Terraform, you will
need to be familiar with these types in order to make your code compile easily,
interact properly with the rest of Terraform, and maintain Terraform's 
the level of portability.</p>
<p>Terraform's source code is 
<a href="http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/">Doxygen</a>
enabled. This means that it's comments have been tagged in such a manner, 
that doxygen can generate class/code documentation. In order to do this, 
you need to: 
<pre>
cd terraform-x.x.x/src
doxygen -g doxygen.rc
</pre>
<p>Doxygen generates Javadoc-style documentation which make browsing class 
hierarchies much easier. If you want to work with terraform and be able 
to browse the source, I recommend doing this as a first step. </p>



<a name="1.1">
<h2>1.1: Coding style</h2>
<p>Terraform follows the GNU coding standard available on the
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/">GNU homepage</a>.  Use consecutive spaces
to indent lines and avoid tab characters.  Turn on tab expansion in your
editor to avoid tab/space mixture hell.  Keeping the code consistant makes
the code base easier to read, but also allows code to be moved around between
files without reformatting.
A brief stylistic overview is given here:</p>

<table border=1>
<tr><th>Do this</th><th>Not this</th></tr>
<tr><td>
<pre>
gint a;
gint b;
</pre>
</td>
<td>
<pre>
gint a,
     b;
</pre></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>
<pre>
gint
function (gint i,
          gint j)
</pre></td>
<td>
<pre>
gint function (gint i, gint j)
</pre>
</td></tr>

<tr><td>
<pre>
if (foo == NULL)
  {
    printf ("Hello\n");
  }
else if (bar == NULL)
  {
    printf ("World\n");
  }
else
  {
    printf ("!\n");
  }
</pre></td>
<td>
<pre>
if (!foo)
  printf ("Hello\n");
else
{
  if (!bar)
    printf ("World\n");
  else
    printf ("!\n"); 
}
</pre>
</td></tr>

<tr><td><pre>(x + y) / 2.0</pre></td><td><pre>(x+y)/2</pre></td></tr>
<tr><td><pre>func () + func2 (x, y)</pre></td><td><pre>func()+func2(x,y)</pre></td></tr>
<tr><td><pre>array[i]</pre></td><td><pre>array [i], array[ i ]</pre></td></tr>
</table>


<a name="1.2">
<h2>1.2: Simple data types</h2>
<p>Terraform uses glib datatypes to avoid problems caused by machine or
compiler specific definitions of datatypes.  Use gint8, gint16, gint32,
guint8, guint16, guint32, gfloat, gdouble, gchar, gint (and the rest)
instead of types such as short, long, unsigned short, unsigned long, etc.</p>

<p>Note that Terraform is a work in progress, and does not itself always adhere
to these guidelines.  Future code cleanups will address these issues.</p>


<a name="1.3">
<h2>1.3: Naming conventions</h2>
<p>It is important to give variables meaningful names.  Terraform attempts
to follow some naming conventions used by Gtk+.  Abbreviations are
avoided except when they are well established.</p>

<h1>3: Adding new source files</h1>
<p>If your changes are minor, such as fixing a bug, you should strive to work
within the existing set of source code files.  Unless the "bug" is a
fundemantal design flaw or something equally serious, you shouldn't have to add
or remove any source files.  If you are considering a bug fix of such
significant scope, you should probably contact 
<a href="mailto:r.gasch@chello.nl">RNG</a> before proceeding.</p>

<p>Many other types of changes, for example adding a new height field operation
such as cratering or erosion, can also be implemented within the framework of
Terraform's existing source code.  If your change falls into the broadly-
defined category of "something neat to do to a heightfield", then odds are good
that you'll be working almost exclusively within HeightFieldOps.cc and
HeightFieldOps.h.</p>

<p>If you've gotten this far and you are still convinced that you need to
create some new source files, for reasons of code sharing, keeping
functionality isolated in well defined modules, or whatever, then that's ok.
In this case, you should probably contact <a
href="mailto:r.gasch@chello.nl">RNG</a> before proceeding, to make
sure he hasn't already taken the filenames you propose to use, and to make sure
that your reasons for adding new source files are sound.  Keep in mind that RNG
is more likely to accept changes that do not involve radical changes to the
code base.  The type of modification that most commonly involves adding new
source files are ones that involve creating new dialog boxes for the user to
interact with.  This is a consequence of the general method of writing code
that uses the gdk/GTK-- toolkits.  Of course, new features almost always
require some type of user interaction, so if you're adding new functionality
you can almost bet on having to create a dialog box or two and add some source
files for that.</p>

<p>Terraform uses the autoconf system to generate its Makefiles, so adding new
source files is easy.  Just put them in Terraform's src/ directory, add the 
filename to src/Makefile.am and then then re-run the configure script in your 
terraform directory in order to generate new Makefiles that will recognize 
your new source files.</p>

<a name="4">
<h1>4: Adding a new input type (i.e. extending File->Open)</h1>
<p>Adding support for a new input format, if you wish to read heightfields from
some file type that Terraform does not currently support, is not difficult.
Terraform's file input mechanism is well designed to support additional types.
You will be working with the HeightFieldReader and HeightFieldIO classes,
defined in HeightFieldReader.{h,cc} and HeightFieldIO.{h,cc}.</p>

<p>Supporting a new input file format involves writing a function to parse that
format, adding logic to detect that format's file type, and adding a call to
your file parsing function.</p>

<p>Add your file parsing function to the HeightFieldReader class.  Give it a
name of the form "read<i>XXX</i>()", where <i>XXX</i> represents the new file
format.  Examples are readGIF, readPGM, etc.  You may also implement private
helper functions in the HeightFieldReader class, if necessary, to assist your
read<i>XXX</i> function.  Your function will need to allocate an array of PTYPE
large enough to hold the data from the file (e.g. myarray = new PTYPE[width *
height];), read the file's data and convert it into PTYPEs in the range 0.0 to
1.0, store that data in your array, and finally assign the heightfield's d_hf
member to your array (e.g. d_hf = myarray;).  Finally, your parsing function
should call HeightFieldReader::checkRead when it is done in order to do some
important post-processing on the new heightfield.</p>

<p>Once you have written your parsing function, you need to hook it into the
HeightFieldIO class.  First, modify HeightFieldIO.h to define a new constant to
represent your file type, if a suitable type is not yet defined.  In that file
you will find definitions for the other file types Terraform already supports.
In HeightFieldIO.cc, you will need to do two things.  One, modify the
HeightFieldIO::getFileType() function to associate the correct file extension
with your file type.  Two, modify the HeightFieldIO::read() function to add a
call to your read<i>XXX</i> function.</p> 



<hr>
<a name="5">
<h1>5: Adding a new output type (i.e. extending File->Save As)</h1>
<p>Adding support for a new output format, if you wish to write heightfields to
some file type that Terraform does not currently support, is not difficult.
Terraform's file output mechanism is well designed to support additional types.
You will be working with the HeightFieldWriter and HeightFieldIO classes,
defined in HeightFieldWriter.{h,cc} and HeightFieldIO.{h,cc}.</p> 

<p>Supporting a new output file format requires writing a function that can
convert heightfield data into some other appropriately structured format, as
well as handle writing any necessary file header or footer information, adding
logic to detect your new file type based on the filename the user has chosen to
save the heightfield to, and adding a call to your writing function.</p> 

<p>Add your writing function to the HeightFieldWriter class.  Give it a name of
the form "write<i>XXX</i>()", where <i>XXX</i> represents the new file format.
Examples are writeTGA, writePGM, etc.  You may also implement private helper
functions in the HeightFieldReader class, if necessary, to assist your
write<i>XXX</i> function.  Your function will need to loop over all the data in
the heightfield (recall that you can use the HeightField::El() function to
access this data), convert it to the appropriate format for your file type, and
write it to a filehandle provided by the HeightFieldWriter class.  The
heightfield data you will be working with will be stored as PTYPEs in the range
0.0 to 1.0.  Finally, your writing function should close the file handle and
call HeightField::setSaved(TRUE) when it is done.</p> 

<p>Once you have written your writing function, you need to hook it into the
HeightFieldIO class.  First, modify HeightFieldIO.h to define a new constant to
represent your file type, if a suitable type is not yet defined.  In that file
you will find definitions for the other file types Terraform already supports.
In HeightFieldIO.cc, you will need to do two things.  One, modify the
HeightFieldIO::getFileType() function to associate the correct file extension
with your file type, if your file type is not already listed.  Two, modify the
HeightFieldIO::write() function to add a call to your write<i>XXX</i>
function.</p>

<h1>6: Modifying the height field</h1>
<p>One obvious class of hack to Terraform are features that do something
interesting to an existing heightfield, such as adding craters, inverting the
terrain, raising or lowering it, etc.  These functions typically reside in
the HeightFieldOps class, which is where you should implement such functions.
Add your function as a new public member function in HeightFieldOps.h, and put
the function in HeightFieldOps.cc.  Your function should have this general
structure:</p>

<pre>
int HeightFieldOps::myFunc(args...) 
{
  // declare any variables you need
  PTYPE	newElevation;

  // loop over the terrain and modify it:
  for(int x=0; x < p_HF->getWidth(); x++)
    for(int y=0; y < p_HF->getWidth(); y++) 
      {
      newElevation = ... ;	// do something cool...
      p_HF->setEl(x,y, newElevation);
      }

  // any broad-scale changes to the heightfield also need to do the following:
  p_HF->gatherStatistics();
  p_HF->setSaved(FALSE);

  // return a status code.
  return(0);
}
</pre>

<p>Of course, depending on the algorithm you're using to modify the terrain,
your function may not contain an internal loop structure exactly like the
above.  Use whatever code you need to make whatever changes you want to the
terrain.  Once you're done, call p_HF->gatherStatistics(); this will 
rescale the height field to the value range 0..1 and do some other 
limited sanity checking. 
</p>

<p>If your function is sufficiently complex, you may need to create a dialog
box, as described elsewhere in this document, to gather parameters from the
user before calling your function.  Finally, you need to patch your function or
dialog box into Terraform's context menu, the one that shows up when you
right-click on a heightfield display window.  You will need to work with
MenuDefs.h, TFWindow.cc, and TFWindowHandler.cc. If you don't want to 
deal with the dialog and menu code, you can mail 
<a href="mailto:r.gasch@chello.nl">RNG</a> who up to this point has 
been very willing to take new code and it supply with an appropriate 
dialog box.</p>

<p>If you do feel like adding the dialog, do the following: In MenuDefs.h, 
create a new constant of the form MENU_HF_<i>MyID</i>, which lists the menu 
position of your function or dialog box.  For example, the
HF->Rotate function is defined as:<p>

<pre>
#define MENU_HF_ROTATE                  "Rotate"
</pre>

<p>In the TFWindow::addMenus function, add your function along with the other
MENU_HF_* functions, with a couple of lines of code like this:</p>

<pre>
s=_(MENU_HF_ROTATE);
MenuElem        hRotate (s, ACC_C,
		SigC::bind(SigC::slot(this, &TFWindow::hfMenuCallback),
		string (s)));
mlHF.push_back (hRotate);
</pre>

<p>Also, in order to correctly support internationalization, you must 
add your newly defined menu string to the <i>char *foobar</i> definition 
at the beginning of TFWindow.cc. Even though the code is #ifdef'ed to 
never be used, GNU gettext expects such a structure in order to properly 
generate the language/resource files.</p>

<p>Finally, connect your menu item to the TFWindowHandler class.  Add a private
member variable of the appropriate function pointer type (e.g. TFPreviewDialog
*, TFBaseDialog *, or just int * if your function doesn't use a dialog box) to
represent your dialog box or function.  Then, add an if-statement to the
TFWindowHandler::hfMenuCallback function, along with the other if-
statements which select among the HF menu items, like this:</p>

<pre>
if (!strcmp (menuitem, MENU_HF_MyID))
        {
        if (!p_myDialog)
                p_myDialog= new TFDialogMyDialog (p_HF, p_HFD);
        p_myDialog->show ();
        }
else
</pre>

<a name="7">
<h1>7: Adding a new terrain generator</h1>
<p>Terraform currently supports two different terrain generators, the spectral
synthesis generator and the subdivision generator.  To add a new terrain
generator, you need to do the following:</p>
<dl>
<dt>Create a class to encapsulate your generator.
<dd>Your class needs to support one method,
generate() in addition to a constructor and destructor.  The constructor will
receive a HeightField pointer that you will need save for use in your generate
function.  Your generate function needs to set the heightfield's d_xsize,
d_ysize, and d_size (remember, d_size is always equal to d_xsize*d_ysize)
members, and create an array of d_size PTYPEs (e.g. myarray = new
PTYPE[d_size];).  Fill that array with values in the range 0.0 to 1.0 by
whatever means you like, then assign the heightfield's d_hf member to your
array (e.g. d_hf = myarray;). 
<dt>Patch your generator into HeightFieldGenRandom.{h,cc}
<dd>The HeightFieldGenRandom class simply chooses at random among the other
terrain generators.  Thus, you need to teach HeightFieldGenRandom about your
new generator in order for it to be available for use when users choose to
generate a random heightfield. 
<dt>Add your generator to the <i>File->New</i> submenu's list of available
terrain generators. 
<dd>You will need to modify MenuDefs.h, and TFWindowMain.*.  If your terrain
generator is sufficiently complex as to require user input, you will also need
to add a pair of TFDialogGen*.{h.cc} files to implement a dialog box so users
can choose parameters for your terrain generator.  See TFDialogGenSubdiv.* for
a good example of how to do this.  For terrain generators that need a dialog
box, the dialog box will be responsible for creating a new object of your
generator's class, getting parameters from the user, and passing those
parameters to your generate() function.  If your generator is simple enough not
to need parameters, then the code you add to TFWindowMain to implement your
<i>File->New</i> submenu option will have to create the new generator object
and call its generate() function. 
</dl>



<hr>
<a name="8">
<h1>8: Debugging Support</h1>
<p>Luckily for you, Terraform comes with a number of fairly robust debugging
mechanisms already in place.  First, the GlobalTrace class allows you to set
(and check) various trace output levels, to give you easy control over how much
debugging output your code generates.  This class also contains the trace()
method, which writes a string to standard out if the current debugging level
matches the level specified in the call to trace().</p>

<p>Next, the GlobalSanityCheck class provides facilities for validating that
certain conditions hold true, and either exiting or printing a warning if they
do not.  GlobalSanityCheck should be used to check the validity of any
assumptions your code makes before that code runs.  In fact, as you browse
through Terraform's source code, you will find calls to
GlobalSanityCheck::warning and GlobalSanityCheck::bailout as the first few
lines of many functions.</p>

<p>Finally, as a last line of defense, Terraform implements exception handling,
to catch various errors that would crash the program and to give users the
options of what to do next.  You shouldn't have to do anything special to make
use of this functionality, although if your code is causing lots of core dumps,
you may well become intimately familiar with Terraform's exception handling
support. If you want to use this built-in exception handler, you must 
run <i>./configure --enable-debug</i> for the exception handling code 
to be enabled.</p>

<p>If you've compiled your own executable anyhow, you might just want 
to recompile with the "-g" flag enabled and then use gdb. I prefer this 
to using the built in debugging support.

<a name="9">
<h1>9: Submitting your changes</h1>
<p>Once you have implemented all your modifications, confirmed them against the
most recent version of Terraform, and <i>debugged</i> your work, then you
should submit your new code to the 
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/mail/?group_id=1765">Terraform Mailing List</a>.  That way
other users can see and comment on your code, and RNG can, if he finds it
worthy, add your code to the main Terraform source distribution.  Here's one
way to do that, using tcsh.  There are many other ways, of course:</p>

<ol>
<li>Make a gzipped tar file (.tgz) containing the diffs between any files you
changed and the original versions of those files.  Note that at this point it
will be very convenient if you've kept copies of the original files, in some
other filename.  Whenever I modify a terraform source file, I always copy it
first to a name of the form "original_name.orig" for safekeeping, as in
"HeightFieldExport.cc.orig".  Let me say again that it is highly desirable that
your diffs be made against the most recent source code release.<br>
<pre>
~/terraform-0.4.6/src/> foreach name (*.orig)
foreach? set oldname=`basename $name .orig`
foreach? diff $oldname $name > $oldname.diff
foreach? end
~/terraform-0.4.6/src/> cd ..
~/terraform-0.4.6/> tar -czf myusername.0.4.6.tgz src/*.diff
</pre>
<li>Uuencode your .tgz file:<br>
<pre>
~/terraform-0.4.6/> uuencode myusername.0.4.6.tgz myusername.0.4.6.tgz > myusername.0.4.6.uu 
</pre>
<li>Post your changes to the <a
href="http://sourceforge.net/mail/?group_id=1765">terraform mailing list</a>:<br>
<pre>
~/terraform-0.4.6/> mail -s 'my spiffy terraform mods against v0.x.x' < myusername.0.4.6.tgz
</pre>
</ol>

<p>Note that your tar file should be named with your username and the version
of terraform to which your changes apply, as in the above example.  Further, if
you have made substantial changes to any of the terraform source files such
that a diff would be impractical, then you may choose to simply include that
whole file in your .tgz file.  However, please use diffs wherever possible.</p>
